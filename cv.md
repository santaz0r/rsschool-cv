### Code Example

---

Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).
For example,

```
[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
```

My solution:

```
function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
  const total = arrayOfSheep.filter((sheep) => {
    return sheep ? sheep : null;
  });
  return total.length;
}
```
